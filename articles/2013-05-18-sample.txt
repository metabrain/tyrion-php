In case I haven't reported already, my thesis revolves around the new Java 8.
Using JDK8, I'm doing during-the-compilation-AST-transformations using some
interesting holes in the javac compiler related to the annotation processor and
the new Java 8 plugin system (that is basically the same thing as the annotation
	processor).

I've been using some very hacked Ant buildfiles to build all the projects and
test 'em. Worked fine so far, after many days trying to figure how to
compile/run all the Java 8 sources without numerous errors everywhere (it's
	really not trivial!). However, since my advisor uses primarily Maven for
his projects and I depend on one of them, I figured, *"Why the hell not convert all
my hacked-together-Ant-supported projects to Maven? **Shouldn't be hard**.*

Almost a two day lost. Nonetheless, after all that work, I figured that maybe Maven
is not that bad, it's just that my Ant-hacks were so specific and unsupported (Eclipse and 	Maven compiler don't support 1.8 Java compliance level yet...) that it took
longer than expected. Now, I can safelly reconfigure the projects in maybe 5
minutes because I've been through the burning coals to figure how to do stuff
properly the first time.
